Description:
This Raspberry Pi LED Blinker project allows you to control and experiment with LED blinking using a Raspberry Pi. The program is written in C and uses the WiringPi library for GPIO control. It provides various features for LED control, including turning LEDs on and off, blinking with customizable frequency and brightness, and recording waveform data to analyze LED behavior.

Features:
Turn off and on both green and red LEDs individually.
Customize LED blinking by selecting the LED to blink, frequency, and brightness.
Record and store waveform data, including timestamps and LED states, to CSV files.
Experiment with LED blinking patterns to understand the effects of frequency and brightness.
User-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction.

This repository is a great starting point for learning about Raspberry Pi GPIO control, LED manipulation, and data recording. You can modify and expand upon this project to explore more advanced LED control and data analysis capabilities. Enjoy experimenting with LEDs and Raspberry Pi!
